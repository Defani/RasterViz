## Overview

**RasterViz** is a professional raster visualization plugin for QGIS designed for researchers, GIS analysts, remote sensing practitioners, environmental scientists, and cartographers who require high-quality scientific raster rendering directly inside the QGIS environment.

The plugin replicates the clean visualization aesthetics of Python's `rasterio.show()` workflow while eliminating the need for external scripting or notebook-based rendering. RasterViz combines scientific visualization principles with a modern PyQt5 graphical user interface, enabling users to generate publication-ready raster maps interactively.

Unlike conventional QGIS styling workflows, RasterViz focuses on:

* Scientific color rendering
* Advanced raster stretching
* Interactive histogram analysis
* Publication-quality legends and colorbars
* Remote sensing optimized colormaps
* Fast live-preview rendering
* Export-ready scientific layouts


---

# Key Features
